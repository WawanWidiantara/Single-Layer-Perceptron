## About the Project

This project utilizes the Titanic dataset to build a machine learning model using a Single Layer Perceptron. The objective is to predict survival probabilities based on input features such as age, class, and gender.

The repository is continuously being improved, with cleaner and optimized code to ensure performance and readability.
